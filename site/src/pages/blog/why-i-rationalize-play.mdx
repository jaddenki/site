why do people play?

play is often described as non-instrumental— something done not for productivity or reward, but for the experience itself. it’s pleasurable, spontaneous, and expressive. it's fundamental not just to humans, but to nearly all species.

but why *play*, really?

several theories try to answer that:

- **surplus energy theory** (schiller, spencer): play is a way to expend excess energy when survival needs are already met.  
- **pre-exercise theory** (karl groos): play is rehearsal — a way to practice real-world functions like hunting, parenting, or collaboration.  
- **psychoanalytic theory** (erik erikson): play is emotional exploration. it lets us test boundaries, roles, and identities in a low-stakes setting.

none of these theories tell the whole story— but together, they hint at something essential. play helps us regulate, connect, and make meaning. it’s a tool for growth *without* being framed as a tool at all.


## play in practice

i started thinking more deeply about this during a summer program i did in high school, surrounded by stem students in a fast-paced, creative environment. we found ourselves discussing the *purpose* of play in an increasingly structured world— where tech often leans toward optimization, efficiency, and output.

this led to one of my favorite small projects: an augmented reality app where you draw a shape that becomes an apple, and a worm eats it. draw a triangle— it’s a triangle apple. the worm still eats it. it was playful, simple, and kind of absurd. but it made people laugh. it also made them think. and it made me wonder:

- what does it mean to *design for play* in extended reality?
- how can i create interactions that serve no purpose except delight?
- where is the boundary between interaction and expression?


## why it matters

as i’ve continued working on  projects, motion tools, and playful interfaces, i keep coming back to this:  
play isn’t the opposite of serious work— it’s often where the most meaningful insights come from.

when you’re allowed to experiment without consequence, you often arrive at something unexpected. playful experiences can lead to emotional connections, deeper learning, or just a moment of joy. and that, to me, makes them worth designing intentionally.


## closing thought

rationalizing play might sound like a contradiction. but in a world where tech often demands productivity, i think play is worth protecting. and understanding. and building for.

because even if we don’t need a reason to play, sometimes it's useful to remember why it matters. what's life without a bit of whimsy?
