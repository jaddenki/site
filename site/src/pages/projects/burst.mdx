[BURST ✷](https://burst.purduehackers.com) was a showcase of student-made technical creative projects,
 organized by [purdue hackers](https://purduehackers.com), a community of students who collaborate, learn, and build kick-ass technical projects. we were able to get a spot at 
 the patti & rusty rueff galleries for 4 hours on december 8th, 2024, and spent the semester building the brand, marketing the exhibit, and setting the projects up for display.

amid finals and final projects, i had the chance to contribute to this event by working on designs for the marketing campaign and helping create the base of the interactive star on the [BURST ✷ webpage](https://burst.purduehackers.com).
