## the quiet revolution of gamifying research

now i'm not saying that academic research is inherently boring. well.. maybe i am, just a tiny bit. especially now. you scroll. you scroll again. oh. the video bores you-- you scroll once again. you watch more ten seconds videos that masquerade as information than finding and reading something you find meaningful. 

in this age, academic research can all too easily feel dry, no matter how groundbreaking the findings. gamifying it lays out information in a unique way that immerses the user in the experience and allows them to take away their own findings (while still having their hand held) <a href="#ref-1" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a><a href="#ref-2" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>. by translating research into a playable system, we don't just present information; we invite players to live the inquiry, make their own decisions, and draw their own conclusions.

at their core, both games and research are complex systems of interlocking parts. a carefully designed game maps out hypotheses, variables, and outcomes just as a scholarly paper does. when you play through those relationships-- navigating challenges that mirror real-world trade-offs-- you remember the feel of each decision far more vividly than you would that of a static paragraph of text <a href="#ref-3" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>. by embedding concepts into game mechanics, abstract ideas then become concrete.

this philosophy draws on the idea of procedural rhetoric-- the persuasive power of rule-based representations <a href="#ref-4" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a> and on empirical research demonstrating that games and interactive media can foster deeper learning and sustained interest <a href="#ref-5" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a><a href="#ref-6" class="footnote-ref">[6]</a>. titles like [papers, please](https://papersplea.se/) and [disco elysium](https://discoelysium.com/) demonstrate how politically charged, narrative-driven games can evoke genuine emotional engagement while conveying complex sociological and ethical dilemmas.

now that spark-- the belief that any research paper can be laid out like a game-- not just a visualization or some sort of interactive media, but a game, one where people can explore, question, and play through information set out through an academic argument--was the catalyst for the c3 game jam.

a **game jam** is an intensive, time-boxed event where small teams rapidly prototype playable experiences around a shared theme or challenge: think brainstorming at warp speed, sketching mechanics on whiteboards, then diving straight into code, art, and sound-- all within a fixed window. over a 48-hour period, interdisciplinary teams came together to translate *niche academic work* into *playable experiences*. it’s a class that brings together computer science, art, engineering, and the humanities at purdue (we plan on running it every spring too! get ready for the spring ’26 c3 game jam—it spans from the friday to sunday before spring break).

## design and creativity

one of our biggest challenges during the jam was helping jammers move beyond these literal visualizations. instead of quoting statistics, we encouraged them to ask: "what question is this paper really asking? what choices can the user make and learn from? how do you turn a paper into a meaningful mechanic?" it wasn't about a literal reproduction but a metaphor. a game didn't need to quote results, it needed to ask the same questions and explore the same tensions.

next spring, i want to emphasize the infinite paths one can go down *no matter the research*-- make a protagonist who isn't human, be some sort of "guiding force." uniqueness allows the user or player to remember it more. projects during the inaugural jam often defaulted to familiar structures under time pressure; by foregrounding conceptual creativity, we hope each game will be as unique as the research it celebrates.

i do understand that during this game jam, many people are using game engines for the first time. to foster experimentation, i hope to introduce some sort of modular "mechanic kit" as a class assignment or resource inspired by hackathon toolkits <a href="#ref-7" class="footnote-ref">[7]</a> offering a way to explore mechanic creation and certain game engines so that users can focus what they're communicating. i noticed also many users used godot engine due to its lower barrier of entry. 
## community and culture

c3 is all about community-based computing and rethinking about how tech intersects with people. i think this jam embodied that. it was low-barrier, high-whimsy, and deeply intentional. it didn't just show off what people could make but showed how they think as well. 

this game jam wasn't just for game devs as well. we had animation majors, psych researchers, electrical engineers, sound designers-- all teaming up to create a game that translated research into an accessible and playable experience.

a part of the jam just felt like joyful chaos-- we wanted moments to make it feel personal. from a venue that looked like a 5 year old's camp-themed birthday party to impromptu [job job](https://www.jackboxgames.com/games/job-job) jackbox sessions, we wove moments of joy and levity throughout the 48 hours. it reminded everyone that research overall and this class wasn't a solitary and monotonous grind, but a shared experience fueled with curiosity.

at the same time, we learned that structure breeds inclusion. clear judging criteria, periodic check-ins, and set meals ensured that everyone felt supported. i want to refine our facilitation methods a bit more to balance creative freedom with guiding scaffolds, drawing on best practices from hackathon studies <a href="#ref-8" class="footnote-ref">[8]</a><a href="#ref-9" class="footnote-ref">[9]</a>.

## planning

a 48 hour event like this has a whole season's worth of logistics behind it. the student lab managers team mapped everything out, from catering for dietary needs to judge selection and outreach and branding + theme refinement. a lot of those decisions were made as a group as we didn't want the event to feel very corporate and cold. we made sure:

- the judges were chill, smart, and passionate about this topic
- the space looked like a 5 year old's birthday party (we made it summer camp themed and thankfully party city had a closing sale...)
- the ta's (ahem.. camp counselors) heavily leaned into our roles and showed our passion
- there was a microwave s'mores night

## takeaways and future visions


this jam wasn't just extracurricular fun; it was for an honors course and also satisfied the scholarly project requirement for [john martinsons honors college](https://honors.purdue.edu/research/scholarly-project.php) at purdue. the best part though? winners recieved $1,000 to further develop their games. this meant that the ideas didn't stop at the prototype, they had room to grow beyond a weekend prototype. i love still seeing conversations between the game jam winners of spring '25 as they continue working on the game :')

if you wanted to see the games made during the c3 spring '25 game jam, they're up on [itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/c3-s25)! check them out :)

by gamifying research, we revolutionize not just how knowledge is delivered, but how it's experienced. in a world drowning in information but dry of knowledge, we offer a path to immersion, empathy, and discovery.
