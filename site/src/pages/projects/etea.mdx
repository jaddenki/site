[wishlist on steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3085040/ETea/) ;)

ETea is a video game about an alien named **glorbo** who crash-landed on earth and now has to survive by working undercover... as a bobarista.

i’ve been developing this with my friends for a while now, and honestly, it means a lot. beneath the goofy premise, we’re exploring themes of identity, belonging, and hiding parts of yourself to fit in, all throughstealthy alien antics. *(psst. we're secretly working on a spin-off game to ship something sooner than etea. but that's a secret)*

i worked on:
- gameplay programming (unity + c#)  
- UI design + pixel art (figma, aseprite)  
- trailers and visual polish (after effects!)

we showcased ETea at [**BURST ✷**](/projects/burst),
 an art gallery-style exhibition at purdue featuring student-made technical/creative projects. 
 we built a special demo version with controller support.
  getting to see people play and react to our game (and give us feedback)
   was genuinely the best part.
